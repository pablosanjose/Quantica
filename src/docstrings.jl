Create a new lattice by applying any non-missing keywords to `lat`.

    lattice(x)

Return the parent lattice of object `x`, of type e.g. `LatticeSlice`, `Hamiltonian`, etc.

## Keywords

- `bravais`: a collection of one or more Bravais vectors of type NTuple{E} or SVector{E}. It can also be an `AbstractMatrix` of dimension `E×L`. The default `bravais = ()` corresponds to a bounded lattice with no Bravais vectors.
- `names`: a collection of Symbols. Can be used to rename `sublats`. Any repeated names will be replaced if necessary by `:A`, `:B` etc. to ensure that all sublattice names are unique.

## Indexing

    lat[kw...]

Indexing into a lattice `lat` with keywords returns `LatticeSlice` representing a finite
collection of sites selected by `siteselector(; kw...)`. See `siteselector` for details on
possible `kw`, and `sites` to obtain site positions.

    lat[]

    supercell(lat::Lattice{E,L}, uc::SMatrix{L,L´,Int}; seed = missing, kw...)

Generate a new `Lattice` from an `L`-dimensional lattice `lat` with a larger unit cell, such
that its Bravais vectors are `br´= br * uc`. Here `uc::SMatrix{L,L´,Int}` is the integer
supercell matrix, with the `L´` vectors `v`s as its columns. If no `v` are given, the new
lattice will have no Bravais vectors (i.e. it will be bounded, with its shape determined by
keywords `kw...`). Likewise, if `L´ < L`, the resulting lattice will be bounded along `L´ -
L` directions, as dictated by `kw...`.

Only sites selected by `siteselector(; kw...)` will be included in the supercell (see
`siteselector` for details on the available keywords `kw`). If no
keyword `region` is given in `kw`, a single Bravais unit cell perpendicular to the `v` axes
will be selected along the `L-L´` bounded directions.

    supercell(lattice::Lattice{E,L}, factors::Integer...; seed = missing, kw...)

Call `supercell` with different scaling along each Bravais vector, so that supercell matrix
`uc` is `Diagonal(factors)`. If a single `factor` is given, `uc = SMatrix{L,L}(factor * I)`

    supercell(h::Hamiltonian, v...; mincoordination = 0, seed = missing, kw...)

Transform the `Lattice` of `h` to have a larger unit cell, while expanding the Hamiltonian
accordingly.

## Keywords

- `seed::NTuple{L,Integer}`: starting cell index to perform search of included sites. By default `seed = missing`, which makes search start from the zero-th cell.
- `mincoordination::Integer`: minimum number of nonzero hopping neighbors required for sites to be included in the supercell. Sites with less coordination will be removed recursively, until all remaining sites satisfy `mincoordination`.

Any missing `region`, `sublat` or `cells` will not be used to constraint the selection.

## Generalization

While `sublats` and `cells` are usually collections of `Symbol`s and `SVector`s,
respectively, they also admit other possibilities:

- If `cells` is a boolean function, `n in cells` will be the result of `cells(n)`

## Usage

elements between individual orbitals, not sites. This distinction is only relevant for
multiorbital Hamiltonians. To access the non-flattened matrix use `h[unflat(dn)]` (see

    h[()]

Special syntax equivalent to `h[(0...)]`, which access the fundamental Bloch harmonic.

## Call syntax

Return a `h::Hamiltonian` from a `ph::ParametricHamiltonian` by applying specific values to
its parameters `params`. If `ph` is a non-parametric `Hamiltonian` instead, this is a no-op.

    h(φs; params...)

Return the flat, sparse Bloch matrix of `h::AbstractHamiltonian` at Bloch phases `φs`, with
applied parameters `params` if `h` is a `ParametricHamiltonian`. The Bloch matrix is defined
as

        H = ∑_dn exp(-im φs⋅dn) H_dn

    onsite(o; sites...)
    onsite(r -> o(r); sites...)

Build a `TighbindingModel` representing a uniform or a position-dependent onsite potential,
respectively, on sites selected by `siteselector(; sites...)` (see `siteselector` for
details).

Site positions are `r::SVector{E}`, where `E` is the embedding dimension of the lattice. The
onsite potential `o` can be a `Number` (for single-orbital sites), a `UniformScaling` (e.g.
`2I`) or an `AbstractMatrix` (use `SMatrix` for performance) of dimensions matching the
number of orbitals in the selected sites. Models may be applied to a lattice `lat` to
produce a `Hamiltonian` with `hamiltonian(lat, model; ...)`, see `hamiltonian`. Position
dependent models are forced to preserve the periodicity of the lattice.

    onsite(m::{TighbindingModel,ParametricModel}; sites...)

Convert `m` into a new model with just onsite terms acting on `sites`.

## Model algebra

Models can be combined using `+`, `-` and `*`, or conjugated with `'`, e.g. `onsite(1) - 2 *
hopping(1)'`.

Build a uniform or position-dependent onsite term modifier, respectively, acting on sites
selected by `siteselector(; sites...)` (see `siteselector` for details).

Site positions are `r::SVector{E}`, where `E` is the embedding dimension of the lattice. The

particular, if no onsite model has been applied to a specific site, its onsite potential
will be zero, and will not be modified by any `@onsite!` modifier. Conversely, if an onsite
model has been applied, `@onsite!` may modify the onsite potential even if it is zero. The

    ϵs, ψs = sp
    ϵs = first(sp)
    ϵs = energies(sp)

In addition, one can extract the `n` eigenpairs closest (in real energy) to a given energy
`ϵ₀` with

    ϵs, ψs = sp[1:n, around = ϵ₀]

More generally, `sp[inds, around = ϵ₀]` will take the eigenpairs at position given by `inds`
after sorting by increasing distance to `ϵ₀`, or the closest eigenpair in `inds` is missing.
If `around` is omitted, the ordering in `sp` is used.

`Vector{<:Subband}` instead of a `Bandstructure` object. This is provided as a lower level
driver without the added slicing functionality of a full `Bandstructure` object, see below.

    bands(h::AbstractHamiltonian; kw...)

Equivalent to `bands(h::AbstractHamiltonian, xcolᵢ...; kw...)` with a default `xcolᵢ =
subdiv(-π, π, 49)`.

## Keywords

- `solver`: eigensolver to use for each diagonalization (see `Eigensolvers`). Default: `ES.LinearAlgebra()`
- `mapping`: a function of the form `(x, y, ...) -> ϕs` or `(x, y, ...) -> ftuple(ϕs...; params...)` that translates points `(x, y, ...)` in the mesh to Bloch phases `ϕs` or phase+parameter FrankenTuples `ftuple(ϕs...; params...)`. See also linecuts below. Default: `identity`
- `transform`: function to apply to each eigenvalue after diagonalization. Default: `identity`
- `degtol::Real`: maximum distance between to nearby eigenvalue so that they are classified as degenerate. Default: `sqrt(eps)`
- `split::Bool`: whether to split bands into disconnected subbands. Default: `true`
- `projectors::Bool`: whether to compute interpolating subspaces in each simplex (for use as GreenSolver). Default: `true`
- `warn::Bool`: whether to emit warning when band dislocations are encountered. Default: `true`
- `showprogress::Bool`: whether to show or not a progress bar. Default: `true`
- `defects`: (experimental) a collection of extra points to add to the mesh, typically the location of topological band defects such as Dirac points, so that interpolation avoids creating dislocation defects in the bands. You need to also increase `patches` to repair the subband dislocations using the added defect vertices. Default: `()`
- `patches::Integer`: (experimental) if a dislocation is encountered, attempt to patch it by searching for the defect recursively to a given order, or using the provided `defects` (preferred). Default: `0`

## Currying

    h |> bands(xcolᵢ...; kw...)

Curried form of `bands` equivalent to `bands(h, xcolᵢ...; kw...)`

## Band linecuts

To do a linecut of a bandstructure along a polygonal path in the `L`-dimensional Brillouin
zone, mapping a set of 1D points `xs` to a set of `nodes`, with `pts` interpolation points
in each segment, one can use the following convenient syntax

    bands(h, subdiv(xs, pts); mapping = (xs => nodes))

Here `nodes` can be a collection of `SVector{L}` or of named Brillouin zone points from the
list (`:Γ`,`:K`, `:K´`, `:M`, `:X`, `:Y`, `:Z`). If `mapping = nodes`, then `xs` defaults to
`0:length(nodes)-1`. See also `subdiv` for its alternative methods.

## Indexing and slicing

    b[i]

Extract `i`-th subband from `b::Bandstructure`. `i` can also be a `Vector`, an
`AbstractRange` or any other argument accepted by `getindex(subbands::Vector, i)`

    b[slice::Tuple]

Compute a section of `b::Bandstructure` with a "plane" defined by `slice = (ϕ₁, ϕ₂,..., ϕₗ[,
ϵ])`, where each `ϕᵢ` or `ϵ` can be a real number (representing a fixed momentum or energy)
or a `:` (unconstrained along that dimension). For bands of an `L`-dimensional lattice,
`slice` will be padded to an `L+1`-long tuple with `:` if necessary. The result is a
collection of of sliced `Subband`s.

"""
    attach(h::AbstractHamiltonian, args..; sites...)
    attach(h::OpenHamiltonian, args...; sites...)

Build an `h´::OpenHamiltonian` by attaching (adding) a `Σ::SelfEnergy` to a finite number of
sites in `h` specified by `siteselector(; sites...)`. This also defines a "contact" on said
sites that can be referred to (with index `i::Integer` for the i-th attached contact) when
slicing Green functions later. Self-energies are taken into account when building the Green
function `g(ω) = (ω - h´ - Σ(ω))⁻¹` of the resulting `h´`, see `greenfunction`.

## Self-energy forms

The different forms of `args` yield different types of self-energies `Σ`. Currently
supported forms are:

    attach(h, gs::GreenSlice, coupling::AbstractModel; sites...)

Adds a generic self-energy `Σ(ω) = V´⋅gs(ω)⋅V` on `h`'s `sites`, where `V` and `V´` are
couplings, given by `coupling`, between said `sites` and the `LatticeSlice` in `gs`. Allowed
forms of `gs` include both `g[bath_sites...]` and `g[contactind::Integer]` where `g` is any
`GreenFunction`.

    attach(h, model::ParametricModel; sites...)

Add self-energy `Σᵢⱼ(ω)` defined by a `model` composed of parametric terms (`@onsite` and
`@hopping`) with `ω` as first argument, as in e.g. `@onsite((ω, r) -> Σᵢᵢ(ω, r))` and
`@hopping((ω, r, dr) -> Σᵢⱼ(ω, r, dr))`

    attach(h, nothing; sites...)

Add a `nothing` contact with a null self-energy `Σᵢⱼ(ω) = 0` on selected sites, which in
effect simply amounts to labeling those sites with a contact number, but does not lead to
any dressing the Green function. This is useful for some `GreenFunction` solvers such as
`GS.KPM` (see `greenfunction`), which need to know the sites of interest beforehand (the
contact sites in this case).

    attach(h, g1D::GreenFunction; reverse = false, transform = identity, sites...)

Add a self-energy `Σ(ω) = h₋₁⋅g1D(ω)[surface]⋅h₁` corresponding to a semi-infinite 1D lead
(i.e. with a finite `boundary`, see `greenfunction`), where `h₁` and `h₋₁` are intercell
couplings, and `g1D` is the lead `GreenFunction`. The `g1D(ω)` is taken at the `suface`
unitcell, either adjacent to the `boundary` on its positive side (if `reverse = false`) or
on its negative side (if `reverse = true`). The positions of the selected `sites` in `h`
must match, modulo an arbitrary displacement, those of the lead unit cell, after applying
`transform` to the latter. If they don't, use the `attach` syntax below.

Advanced: If the `g1D` does not have any self-energies, the produced self-energy is in fact
an `ExtendedSelfEnergy`, which is numerically more stable than a naive implementation of
`RegularSelfEnergy`'s, since `g1D(ω)[surface]` is never actually computed. Conversely, if
`g1D` has self-energies attached, a `RegularSelfEnergy` is produced.

    attach(h, g1D::GreenFunction, coupling::AbstractModel; reverse = false, transform = identity,  sites...)

Add a self-energy `Σ(ω) = V´⋅g1D(ω)[surface]⋅V` corresponding to a 1D lead (semi-infinite or
infinite), but with couplings `V` and `V´`, defined by `coupling`, between `sites` and the
`surface` lead unitcell (or the one with index zero if there is no boundary) . See also
Advanced note above.

## Currying

    h |> attach(args...; sites...)

Curried form equivalent to `attach(h, args...; sites...)`.

`cell_index` should be a collection of `L` integers, where `L` is the lattice dimension.

    greenfunction(h::Union{AbstractHamiltonian,OpenHamiltonian}, solver::GreenSolver)

Build a `g::GreenFunction` of Hamiltonian `h` using `solver`. See `GreenSolvers` for
available solvers. If `solver` is not provided, a default solver is chosen automatically
based on the type of `h`.

## Currying

    h |> greenfunction(solver)

Curried form equivalent to `greenfunction(h, solver)`.

## Partial evaluation

`GreenFunction`s allow independent, partial evaluation of their positions (producing a
`GreenSlice`) and energy/parameters (producing a `GreenSolution`). Depending on the solver,
this may avoid repeating calculations unnecesarily when sweeping over either of these with
the other fixed.

    g[ss]
    g[siteselector(; ss...)]

Build a `gs::GreenSlice` that represents a Green function at arbitrary energy and parameter
values, but at specific sites on the lattice defined by `siteselector(; ss...)`, with
`ss::NamedTuple` (see `siteselector`).

    g[contact_index::Integer]

Build a `GreenSlice` equivalent to `g[contact_sites...]`, where `contact_sites...`
correspond to sites in contact number `contact_index` (must have `1<= contact_index <=
number_of_contacts`). See `attach` for details on attaching contacts to a Hamiltonian.

    g[:]

Build a `GreenSlice` over all contacts.

    g[dst, src]

Build a `gs::GreenSlice` between sites specified by `src` and `dst`, which can take any of
the forms above. Therefore, all the previous single-index slice forms correspond to a
diagonal block `g[i, i]`.

    g[diagonal(i, kernel = missing)]

If `kernel = missing`, efficiently construct `diag(g[i, i])`. If `kernel` is a matrix,
return `tr(g[site, site] * kernel)` over each site encoded in `i`. Note that if there are
several orbitals per site, these will have different length (i.e. number of orbitals vs
number of sites). See also `diagonal`.


    g(ω; params...)

Build a `gω::GreenSolution` that represents a retarded Green function at arbitrary points on
the lattice, but at fixed energy `ω` and system parameter values `param`. If `ω` is complex,
the retarded or advanced Green function is returned, depending on `sign(imag(ω))`. If `ω` is
`Real`, a small, positive imaginary part is automatically added internally to produce the
retarded `g`.

    gω[i]
    gω[i, j]
    gs(ω; params...)

For any `gω::GreenSolution` or `gs::GreenSlice`, build the Green function matrix fully
evaluated at fixed energy, parameters and positions. The matrix is dense and has scalar
elements, so that any orbital structure on each site is flattened.

`GreenSolvers` is a Quantica submodule containing several pre-defined Green function
solvers. The alias `GS` can be used in place of `GS`. Currently supported solvers and their
possible keyword arguments are

- `GS.SparseLU()` : Direct inversion solver for 0D Hamiltonians using a `SparseArrays.lu(hmat)` factorization
- `GS.Spectrum(; spectrum_kw...)` : Diagonalization solver for 0D Hamiltonians using `spectrum(h; spectrum_kw...)`
    - `spectrum_kw...` : keyword arguments passed on to `spectrum`
    - This solver does not accept ParametricHamiltonians. Convert to Hamiltonian with `h(; params...)` first. Contact self-energies that depend on parameters are supported.
- `GS.Schur(; boundary = Inf)` : Solver for 1D Hamiltonians based on a deflated, generalized Schur factorization
    - `boundary` : 1D cell index of a boundary cell, or `Inf` for no boundaries. Equivalent to removing that specific cell from the lattice when computing the Green function.
- `GS.KPM(; order = 100, bandrange = missing, kernel = I)` : Kernel polynomial method solver for 0D Hamiltonians
    - `order` : order of the expansion in Chebyshev polynomials `Tₙ(h)` of the Hamiltonian `h` (lowest possible order is `n = 0`).
    - `bandrange` : a `(min_energy, max_energy)::Tuple` interval that encompasses the full band of the Hamiltonian. If `missing`, it is computed automatically.
    - `kernel` : generalization that computes momenta as `μₙ = Tr[Tₙ(h)*kernel]`, so that the local density of states (see `ldos`) becomes the density of the `kernel` operator.
    - This solver does not allow arbitrary indexing of the resulting `g::GreenFunction`, only on contacts `g[contact_ind::Integer]`. If the system has none, we can add a dummy contact using `attach(h, nothing; sites...)`, see `attach`.

    - `bands_arguments`: positional arguments passed on to `bands`
    - `bands_kw`: keyword arguments passed on to `bands`
    - `boundary`: either `missing` (no boundary), or `dir => cell_pos` (single boundary), where `dir::Integer` is the Bravais vector normal to the boundary, and `cell_pos::Integer` the value of cell indices `cells[dir]` that define the boundary (i.e. `cells[dir] <= cell_pos` are vaccum)

    densitymatrix(gs::GreenSlice; opts...)

Compute a `ρ::DensityMatrix` at thermal equilibrium on sites encoded in `gs`. The actual
matrix for given system parameters `params`, and for a given chemical potential `mu` and
temperature `kBT` is obtained by calling `ρ(mu = 0, kBT = 0; params...)`. The algorithm used is
specialized for the GreenSolver used, if available. In this case, `opts` are options for
said algorithm.

    densitymatrix(gs::GreenSlice, (ωmin, ωmax); opts..., quadgk_opts...)
    densitymatrix(gs::GreenSlice, (ωpoints...); opts..., quadgk_opts...)

As above, but using a generic algorithm that relies on numerical integration along a contour
in the complex plane, between points `(ωmin, ωmax)` (or along a polygonal path connecting
`ωpoints`), which should be chosen so as to encompass the full system bandwidth. Keywords
`quadgk_opts` are passed to the `QuadGK.quadgk` integration routine. See below for
additiona `opts`.

    densitymatrix(gs::GreenSlice, ωmax::Number; opts...)

As above with `ωmin = -ωmax`.

## Full evaluation

    ρ(μ = 0, kBT = 0; params...)   # where ρ::DensityMatrix

Evaluate the density matrix at chemical potential `μ` and temperature `kBT` (in the same
units as the Hamiltonian) for the given `g` parameters `params`, if any. The result is given
as an `OrbitalSliceMatrix`, see its docstring for further details.

## Algorithms and keywords

The generic integration algorithm allows for the following `opts` (see also `josephson`):

- `omegamap`: a function `ω -> (; params...)` that translates `ω` at each point in the integration contour to a set of system parameters. Useful for `ParametricHamiltonians` which include terms `Σ(ω)` that depend on a parameter `ω` (one would then use `omegamap = ω -> (; ω)`). Default: `ω -> (;)`, i.e. no mapped parameters.
- `imshift`: a small imaginary shift to add to the integration contour. Default: `sqrt(eps)` for the relevant number type.
- `post`: a function to apply to the result of the integration. Default: `identity`.
- `slope`: the integration contour is a sawtooth path connecting `(ωmin, ωmax)`, or more generally `ωpoints`, which are usually real numbers encompasing the system's bandwidth. Between each pair of points the path increases and then decreases linearly with the given `slope`. Default: `1.0`.

Currently, the following GreenSolvers implement dedicated densitymatrix algorithms:

- `GS.Spectrum`: based on summation occupation-weigthed eigenvectors. No `opts`.
- `GS.KPM`: based on the Chebyshev expansion of the Fermi function. Currently only works for zero temperature and only supports `nothing` contacts (see `attach`). No `opts`.

    current(h::AbstractHamiltonian; charge = -I, direction = 1)

Build an `Operator` object that behaves like a `ParametricHamiltonian` in regards to calls

where `tᵢⱼ` are the hoppings in `h`. This operator is equal to ``∂h/∂Aᵢ``, where `Aᵢ`
is a gauge field along `direction = i`.

    current(gs::GreenSlice; charge = -I, direction = missing)

Build `Js::CurrentDensitySlice`, a partially evaluated object representing the equilibrium
local current density `Jᵢⱼ(ω)` at arbitrary energy `ω` from site `j` to site `i`, both taken
from a specific lattice slice. The current is computed along a given `direction` (see

    current(gω::GreenSolution; charge = -I, direction = missing)

Build `Jω::CurrentDensitySolution`, as above, but for `Jᵢⱼ(ω)` at a fixed `ω` and arbitrary
sites `i, j`. See also `greenfunction` for details on building a `GreenSlice` and
`GreenSolution`.

The local current density is defined here as ``Jᵢⱼ(ω) = (2/h) rᵢⱼ Re Tr[(Hᵢⱼgⱼᵢ(ω) -
gᵢⱼ(ω)Hⱼᵢ) * charge]``, with the integrated local current given by ``Jᵢⱼ = ∫ f(ω) Jᵢⱼ(ω)
dω``. Here `Hᵢⱼ` is the hopping from site `j` at `rⱼ` to `i` at `rᵢ`, `rᵢⱼ = rᵢ - rⱼ`,
`charge` is the charge of carriers in orbital space (see Keywords), and `gᵢⱼ(ω)` is the
retarded Green function between said sites.

## Keywords

- `charge` : for multiorbital sites, `charge` can be a general matrix, which allows to compute arbitrary currents, such as spin currents.
- `direction`: as defined above, `Jᵢⱼ(ω)` is a vector. If `direction` is `missing` the norm `|Jᵢⱼ(ω)|` is returned. If it is an `u::Union{SVector,Tuple}`, `u⋅Jᵢⱼ(ω)` is returned. If an `n::Integer`, `Jᵢⱼ(ω)[n]` is returned.

Given a partially evaluated `Jω::CurrentDensitySolution` or `ρs::CurrentDensitySlice`, build

    conductance(gs::GreenSlice; nambu = false)

Given a slice `gs = g[i::Integer, j::Integer]` of a `g::GreenFunction`, build a partially
evaluated object `G::Conductance` representing the zero-temperature, linear,
differential conductance `Gᵢⱼ = dIᵢ/dVⱼ` between contacts `i` and `j` at arbitrary bias `ω =
eV` in units of `e^2/h`. `Gᵢⱼ` is given by

      Gᵢⱼ =  e^2/h × Tr{[im*δᵢⱼ(gʳ-gᵃ)Γⁱ-gʳΓⁱgᵃΓʲ]}         (nambu = false)
      Gᵢⱼ =  e^2/h × Tr{[im*δᵢⱼ(gʳ-gᵃ)Γⁱτₑ-gʳΓⁱτ₃gᵃΓʲτₑ]}   (nambu = true)

Here `gʳ = g(ω)` and `gᵃ = (gʳ)' = g(ω')` are the retarded and advanced Green function of
the system, and `Γⁱ = im * (Σⁱ - Σⁱ')` is the decay rate at contact `i`. For Nambu systems
(`nambu = true`), the matrices `τₑ=[I 0; 0 0]` and `τ₃ = [I 0; 0 -I]` ensure that charge
reversal in Andreev reflections is properly taken into account. For normal systems (`nambu =
false`), the total current at finite bias and temperatures is given by ``Iᵢ = e/h × ∫
dω ∑ⱼ [fᵢ(ω) - fⱼ(ω)] Gᵢⱼ(ω)``, where ``fᵢ(ω)`` is the Fermi distribution in lead `i`.

## Keywords

- `nambu` : whether to consider the Hamiltonian of the system is written in a Nambu basis, each site containing `N` electron orbitals followed by `N` hole orbitals.

## Full evaluation

    G(ω; params...)

    josephson(gs::GreenSlice, ωmax; omegamap = ω -> (;), phases = missing, imshift = missing, slope = 1, post = real, atol = 1e-7, quadgk_opts...)

For a `gs = g[i::Integer]` slice of the `g::GreenFunction` of a hybrid junction, build a
`J::Josephson` object representing the equilibrium (static) Josephson current `I_J` flowing
into `g` through contact `i`, integrated from `-ωmax` to `ωmax`. The result of `I_J` is
given in units of `qe/h` (`q` is the dimensionless carrier charge). `I_J` can be written as
``I_J = Re ∫ dω f(ω) j(ω)``, where ``j(ω) = (qe/h) × 2Tr[(ΣʳᵢGʳ - GʳΣʳᵢ)τz]``.

## Full evaluation

    J(kBT = 0; params...)   # where J::Josephson

Evaluate the current `I_J` at temperature `kBT` (in the same units as the Hamiltonian) for
the given `g` parameters `params`, if any.

## Keywords

- `omegamap`: a function `ω -> (; params...)` that translates `ω` at each point in the integration contour to a set of system parameters. Useful for `ParametricHamiltonians` which include terms `Σ(ω)` that depend on a parameter `ω` (one would then use `omegamap = ω -> (; ω)`). Default: `ω -> (;)`, i.e. no mapped parameters.
- `phases` : collection of superconducting phase biases to apply to the contact, so as to efficiently compute the full current-phase relation `[I_J(ϕ) for ϕ in phases]`. Note that each phase bias `ϕ` is applied by a `[cis(-ϕ/2) 0; 0 cis(ϕ/2)]` rotation to the self energy, which is almost free. If `missing`, a single `I_J` is returned.
- `imshift`: if `missing` the initial and final integration points `± ωmax` are shifted by `im * sqrt(eps(ωmax))`, to avoid the real axis. Otherwise a shift `im*imshift` is applied (may be zero if `ωmax` is greater than the bandwidth).
- `slope`: if non-zero, the integration will be performed along a piecewise-linear path in the complex plane `(-ωmax, -ωmax/2 * (1+slope*im), 0, ωmax/2 * (1+slope*im), ωmax)`, taking advantage of the holomorphic integrand `f(ω) j(ω)` and the Cauchy Integral Theorem for faster convergence.
- `post`: function to apply to the result of `∫ dω f(ω) j(ω)` to obtain the result, `post = real` by default.
- `atol`: absolute integration tolerance. The default `1e-7` is chosen to avoid excessive integration times when the current is actually zero.
- `quadgk_opts` : extra keyword arguments (other than `atol`) to pass on to the function `QuadGK.quadgk` that is used for the integration.

    OrbitalSliceArray <: AbstractArray

A type of `AbstractArray` defined over a set of orbitals (see also `orbaxes`). It wraps a
regular array that can be obtained with `parent(::OrbitalSliceArray)`, and supports all the
general AbstractArray interface. In addition, it also supports indexing using
`siteselector`s and `cellindices`. `OrbitalSliceVector` and `OrbitalSliceMatrix` are special
cases of `OrbitalSliceArray` of dimension 1 and 2 respectively.

This is the common output type produced by `GreenFunctions` and most observables.

Note that for `m::OrbitalSliceMatrix`, `mat[i]` is equivalent to `mat[i,i]`, and `mat[;
sel...]` is equivalent to `mat[(; sel...), (; sel...)]`.

# `siteselector` indexing

    mat[(; rowsites...), (; colsites...)]
    mat[rowsel::SiteSelector, colsel::SiteSelector]

If we index an `OrbitalSliceMatrix` with `s::NamedTuple` or a `siteselector(; s...)`, we
obtain a new `OrbitalSliceMatrix` over the orbitals of the selected sites.

# `cellsites` indexing

    mat[cellsites(cell_index, site_indices)]
    mat[cellsites(row_cell_index, row_site_indices), cellsites(col_cell_index, col_site_indices)]

If we index an `OrbitalSliceMatrix` with `cellsites`, we obtain an unwrapped `Matrix` over
the sites with `site_indices` within cell with `cell_index`. Here `site_indices` can be
an `Int`, a container of `Int`, or a `:` (for all sites in the unit cell). If any of the
specified sites are not already in `orbaxes(mat)`, indexing will throw an error.

Note that in this case we do not obtain a new `OrbitalSliceMatrix`. This behavior is
required for performance, as re-wrapping in a new `OrbitalSliceMatrix` requires recomputing
and allocating the new `orbaxes`.

    view(mat, rows::CellSites, cols::Cellsites = rows)

Like the above, but returns a view instead of a copy of the indexed orbital matrix.

Note: `diagonal` indexing is currently not supported by `OrbitalSliceArray`.
